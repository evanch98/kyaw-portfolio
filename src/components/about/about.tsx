          I have spent 7 years studying medicine at the University of Medicine
          1, Yangon. Due to several reasons, including pandemic, I had to drop
          out of the university. For as long as I can remember, I have always
          been into technology and working with computers. In 2021, I started
          learning programming with Python, which made me love programming even
          more.

          After exploring several career options, I was quickly drawn to
          front-end web development. I started learning HTML and CSS to build
          simple websites. Fascinated with how intricate web development can be,
          I was quickly drawn to learn more. I started learning JavaScript and
          was even more enthused with making websites interactive. I am now
          spending my time building projects with React JS, Next JS, Tailwind
          CSS, and MongoDB and learning new technologies.

          Apart from coding, I enjoy swimming. My favorite movie and TV show

          team is Liverpool FC based in Liverpool, England. I also watch NBA
          occasionally. My favorite NBA team is Golden State Warriors.
